// The Zoo should have enclosures(or a CreatureManagementUnit which holds these), staff (could be an abstract class above zookeeper and shopstaff and vet and manager who have a weekly salary, have names), a ticket office/shop.
// the responsibility for feeding animals is abstracted away to zookeepers - perhaps they also have to buy the feed and keep an eye on the stocks.
// responsibility for tickets is with the ticket office
// responsibility for merchandise is with the shop
// Zoo - or Zoo Manager maybe? - needs to be able to say what animals the zoo has.
// has an array list of enclosures

// at the end of the day we set the takings of the ticket office back to 0 - or at the start of a day. And we also reset currentVisitors to zero and ticketsSold to 0. At the end of a day we would probably save the stuff somewhere.
