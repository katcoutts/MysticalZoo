##Fantasy Zoo Manager

Goal: Practice OO modelling  in Java (unit tests, no UI)

You have been asked to create a zoo management app so that we can manage our dragons, unicorns and other mystical beings. The user must be able to add enclosures, add / remove animals, feed animals and anything else you can dream up!

###Additionally:
 
* Animals cannot be placed in the same enclosure if they would eat one and other. 
* Animal babies can be sold(!) to other zoos :/
* Visitors can enter / exit the zoo if there are tickets left. 
* View the total income for the zoo.
* Animals can randomly go on a rampage and break out of their enclosures




Feeding:
perhaps have a zookeeper for each enclosure who can feed the animals.
Need to have a belly for animals.
Or have a diary which keeps track of when animals are fed??
Zookeeper should have a diary that keeps track of stuff in their enclosure.
Do we need to give each class of animal a list of food it eats?


Predators:
Do we give each creature a list of its predators. Or each creature a list of its prey?
Maybe prey and then if two animals don't have any prey they'll be fine together???

Tickets:
Do we actually need tickets or just a capacity?
Ticket office needs to keep track of tickets sold for income.
Also needs to keep track of how many visitors are in the zoo.

Adding to an enclosure:
The CMU should work out which enclosure to put it in (refer back to karaoke homework for idea) and the relevant enclosure should then add the creature to it?
